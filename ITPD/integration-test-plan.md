## 1. Introduction
###  1. Revision History

### 2. Purpose and Scope
In our project, the Integration Testing Plan Document is an important part, which can guarantee all the subcomponents be  integrated consistently.

The main purpose of this document is to make up the system when the subcomponents need to be revised according to the user's requirements or other unexpected reasons. The  Integration Testing Plan Document can give us a clear and simple way to organize all the testing of subcomponents. We will provide these sections as follows:
  - To introduce the integration testing subsystems and their subcomponents involved in the integration activity.
  - The Elements to be Integrated and their entry criteria.
  - A description of the Integration Testing Strategy.
  - The Sequence of Components needs to be integrated, including Software Integration Sequence and Subsystem Integration Sequence.
  - Individual steps and test description and their input data and the expected output.
  - A description of performance analysis.
  - All the tools used in testing, and a description of the operating environment that perform all the tests.
