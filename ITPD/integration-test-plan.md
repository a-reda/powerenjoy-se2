## 1. Introduction
### 1. Purpose and Scope

In our project, the Integration Testing Plan Document is an important part, which can guarantee all the subcomponents be  integrated consistently.

The main purpose of this document is to make up the system when the subcomponents need to be revised according to the user's requirements or other unexpected reasons. The  Integration Testing Plan Document can give us a clear and simple way to organize all the testing of subcomponents. We will provide these sections as follows:
  - To introduce the integration testing subsystems and their subcomponents involved in the integration activity.
  - The Elements to be Integrated and their entry criteria.
  - A description of the Integration Testing Strategy.
  - The Sequence of Components needs to be integrated, including Software Integration Sequence and Subsystem Integration Sequence.
  - Individual steps and test description and their input data and the expected output.
  - A description of performance analysis.
  - All the tools used in testing, and a description of the operating environment that perform all the tests.

## 2. Integration Strategy

### 1. Entry Criteria

For doing this part we should ensure that all units of project work can commence to achieve the corresponding unit test quality objectives and output the corresponding test report.

Besides, the following documents should have been completed, reviewed, approved to do unit testing phase, for instance, the Requirements Analysis and Specification Document and the Design Document. W.R.T integration testing phase, we assume that the project has already being code-complete. And there are no missing features or media elements. The product satisfies the performance and memory requirements specified by the Functional Spec. All priority bugs have been fixed and closed. Internal documentation has been updated to reflect the current state of the product.

Also, we should as far as possible to keep the percentage of completion of every component with respect to its functionalities as:

- 100% for the Data Persistence component
- At least 90% for the **Car Management** subsystem
- At least 90% for the **Reservation and Billing Management** subsystem
- At least 80% for the **System Administration and Account Management** subsystems
- At least 70% for the **Client Application**

### 2. Elements to be Integrated

As we presented before in the design document our system is composed by many components and units. So in this section, we will list all the main components which will be integrated in this phase. And we concern the integration phase as two levels of abstraction:
- High-level components integration testing
- Lower-level components integration testing

For high-level integration testing, as we introduced 3-tier structure to build our system(PowerEnjoy) in Design Document so we will follow the structure to process the testing, 1. presentation tier ( mobile client, web client, web server ), 2. logic tier ( application server ), 3. persistence tier ( DB server ).

At lower-level integration testing, we decided to integrate those components which are highly depending on one another to oï¬€er the higher level functionalities of PowerEnjoy. In this case, these components will be involved : Ride controller, Bill controller, Reservation controller, Economic controller. And we assume that the car controller and charge station and the interaction between car and charge station will be well integration tested by third part.

### 3. Integration Testing Strategy

The goal of integration testing is to uncover errors that may arise when two or more components are integrated together. As stated before, unit tests are performed and validated before conducting the integration tests. The latter provides assurance that bugs arise from the integrations and not from the components (units) themselves.

We opted for a bottom-up strategy because of many reasons. First, we are using a lot of already-developed or commercially available components that interact directly with our low level components. Since those components are already tested, they represent reliable building blocks to integrate from. Second, using a bottom-up approach removes the need to develop stubs that are needed in a top-down approach. In addition to that, our main datasources (database and car parameters) are already tested which removes the need for stubs. Furthermore, the low-level modules are the most critical in our application (model, localization and car communication) and almost all other components depend on them. So the bottom-up approach ensures that these components are integrated first making sure that they are bug-free earlier. In case errors are uncovered, they can be fixed early in the process.
