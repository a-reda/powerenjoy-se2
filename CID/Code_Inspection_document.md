### 1. Introduction

Code inspection is the most formal review type. It is led by the trained moderators. During inspection the documents are prepared and checked thoroughly by the reviewers before the meeting. It involves peers to examine the product. A separate preparation is carried out during which the product is examined and the defects are found.

### 2. Assigned Class

Requires taxcommon.class

TaxWare software

Why are they using BigDecimal. Currency calculations require precision to a specific degree, such as two digits after the decimal for most currencies. They also require a specific type of rounding behavior, such as always rounding up in the case of taxes.

Our group assigned class is '../apache-ofbiz-16.11.01/applications/order/src/main/java/org/apache/ofbiz/order/thirdparty/taxware/TaxwareUTL.java'. And our task is to perform the inspection and report on the quality status of selected code extracts using the checklist for Java code inspection reported. Also we are asked to deliver a document having the structure described in the code inspection assignments document.
