#### 2. Assigned class

Requires taxcommon.class

The class assigned to us is TaxWareUTL. The class, that is part of the following package
**org.apache.ofbiz.order.thirdparty.taxware** . The class is part of an integration third party software, called TaxWare. This software is a solution for calculating the taxes.

The main goal of this integration is to be able to write TaxWare libraries.
After exploring the other java files present with this one, we found class TaxwareServices that make use of TaxwareUTL. This class instantiates TaxwareUTL and sets a shipping address, a shipping amount and items. The process() function is then called in order to generate the file.  

TaxWare software

Why are they using BigDecimal. Currency calculations require precision to a specific degree, such as two digits after the decimal for most currencies. They also require a specific type of rounding behavior, such as always rounding up in the case of taxes.
